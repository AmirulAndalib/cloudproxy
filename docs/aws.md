To use AWS as a provider, youâ€™ll first need to create an IAM User.

## Steps

1. Login to your AWS console.
2. Go to Identity and Access Management (IAM).
3. On the left-hand panel, click 'Users'.
4. Click 'Add user'.
5. Choose a username e.g. CloudProxy and select 'Programmatic access', then click Next.
6. Click 'Attach existing policies directly' and then select 'AmazonEC2FullAccess', then click Next.
7. Tag is optional, you may want to create the key as 'CloudProxy', then click Next.
8. Now Review and then click 'Create user'.

Now you have your access key and secret access key, you can now use AWS as a proxy provider, below details of the environment variables.

## Configuration options
